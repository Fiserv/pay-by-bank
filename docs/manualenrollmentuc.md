# Manual Enrollment Architecture

## Explanation of Feature

The consumer has an option to manually key in all information required for ConnectPay enrollment into the enrollment screen.

Usually after a manual enrollment, two micro deposits are made to the consumerâ€™s bank account. The consumer waits for 1-3 business days for these micro deposits to appear in their bank account, following which he/she needs to validate their account by answering micro deposit amount questions via the Micro Deposit Validation process.

The consumer is in a pending validation status and will not be able to transact until the validation is completed.

## Implementation Steps: Manual Enrollment

### Create Consumer Profile (If fdCustomerId not already present for the user) 

[Create Consumer Profile](?path=./docs/implementationguide.md)


### Create Session Token 
[Create Session Token](?path=./docs/implementationguide.md)
>Note: See section labeled Create Session Token


### Initialize and Launch ConnectPay SDK 

You will want to go to the specific mobile operating section and look to initialize the App


[WebSDK](?path=./docs/websdk.md)

[iOS](?path=./docs/iossdk.md)

[Android](?path=./docs/androidsdk.md)


### Additional Steps

<ol>
  <li>Pass necessary data to the SDK(including `fdCustomerId`)</li>
  <li>SDK presents the screens to consumer to capture consumer information</li>
  <li>SDK completes enrollment process and returns NONCE to merchantApp</li>
  <li>NONCE passed back to merchant server</li>
  <li>Merchant server does a server-to-server GetData call to retrieve `fdAccountId` generated after consumer data vaulting. Merchant additionally receives the current consumer status as a part of this call</li>
  <li>Merchant server stores the `fdCustomerId`, `fdAccountId` (optional) against the externalId in their system for future use</li>
</ol>

>Note: Merchant server stores the fdCustomerId, fdAccountId (optional) against the externalID in their system for future use.
