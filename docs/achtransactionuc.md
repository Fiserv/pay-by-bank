# ACH Transaction Architecture
Depending on merchant setup, ACH Transactions can be sent to ConnectPay using Universal Commerce (uCom), Buypass or through PaybyBank Payment through FirstAPI.

>Note: Below is information on PaybyBank Payment through FirstAPI. For uCOM and Buypass, you will need to refer to the respective Implementation guide links below for setup*

[uCOM](https://developer.fiserv.com/product/ConnectedCommerce/docs/?path=docs/documentation/Standard_Implementation_Guide.md)
<br>
[Buypass](Coming Soon)


## Explanation of Feature
All payments are server-to-server communication between the merchant server and FirstAPI. Transactions can be initiated using `fdAccountId` or, PaybyBank PaymentNumber
